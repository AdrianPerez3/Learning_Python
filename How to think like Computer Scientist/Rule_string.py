    Rules are very much like if statements.
    We are going to start with a string and iterate over each of its characters.
    As we apply the rules to one string we leave that string alone and create a brand new string using the accumulator pattern. When we are all done with the original we replace it with the new string.

        rhstr = 'B'   # Rule 1
    elif lhch == 'B':
        rhstr = 'AB'  # Rule 2
    else:
        rhstr = lhch    # no rules apply so keep the character

    return rhstr


def processString(oldStr):
    newstr = ""
    for ch in oldStr:
        newstr = newstr + applyRules(ch)

    return newstr
