## Comprehending Data V0.5

# Now we have another problem duplicates
# Coach stated his demand "three fastest timesfor each athlete."

'''
our goal is -> producing the three fastest times for each athlete.
    And, of course, thereâ€™s no place for any duplicated times in your
output.

'''
# Let's work on that!

# For Accessing the first three data items from any list, we use list slicing

list_ = [1,2,3,4,5,6,6,7,8,8,9]

list_[0:3]# Will give the first 3 element

# But What about the duplicates
# We have to remove the duplicates, How?
