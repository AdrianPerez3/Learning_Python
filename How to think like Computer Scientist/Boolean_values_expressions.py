''' Boolean Values and Boolean Expressions '''

# The python type for storing true and false values is called bool

# There are only two boolean values: True, False

# true and false ->  those are not boolean values because python is case sensitive

print True
print type(True)

''' Boolean values are not strings '''

print type(True)
print type("True")

'''The Comparison operators are resulting the booleans '''

print 5 == 5 # True
print 5 == 6 # False


'''
x != y               # x is not equal to y
x > y                # x is greater than y
x < y                # x is less than y
x >= y               # x is greater than or equal to y
x <= y               # x is less than or equal to y

'''
print 5 > 6 # False
print 5 != 6 # True
print 5 < 6 # True
