# Designing with MVC

''' The best way to make an approach is using Model-View-Controller(MVC) '''

# The Model         :  the code to store your webapp's data

# The View          :  The code to format and display your webapp's user interface(s)

# The controller    :  The code to glue your webapp together and provide its business logic
