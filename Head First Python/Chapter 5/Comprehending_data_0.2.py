# We have to use some kind of sorting but how?

# We have used sort()
x.sort()
x

sorted_y = sorted(y)
y
sorted_y

# We have used sorted because it only shows the sorted version, we don't want to mess with data.

Ok! It's more tidy but still some mistakes in it...

#The minute and seconds separators are confusing Pythonâ€™s sorting technology.

# Python sorts the string as well as numbers
# a dash comes before a period, which itself comes before a colon.
